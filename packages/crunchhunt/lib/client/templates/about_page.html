## What Is This?

CrunchHunt lists the top [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com) posts of each day, ranked by popularity (a bit like [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com)). It was built by [@SachaGreif](http://twitter.com/SachaGreif).

You can now also get the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crunchhunt-chrome-extensi/gddipdekcoklinkmnhffpgnabejbpeaa) (thanks [@edgarjs](https://twitter.com/edgarjs)!)

## How It Was Built

CrunchHunt uses [Telescope](http://telesc.pe), a free open-source app based on the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) JavaScript framework that makes it very easy to create your own communities. 

It uses Telescope's RSS feed parsing feature to automatically import TechCrunch articles, then ranks them based on their share count. You can [read more about the process here](http://www.telesc.pe/blog/making-of-crunchhunt/).

Other examples of Telescope-based sites include:

- [Crater.io](http://crater.io): a forum for Meteor news.
- [Bootstrappers.io](http://bootstrappers.io): a commmunity for bootstrappers. 
- [CodeBuddies](http://hangouts.codebuddies.org/): a site for finding study group partners.

## Other Technical Details

CrunchHunt is hosted on [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) (server) and [Compose](http://compose.io) (database), and also uses [Embedly](embed.ly) to generate link thumbnails and [Kimono Labs](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) to retrieve shares counts for each link. 

Real-time performance metrics are provided by [Kadira](https://kadira.io/).
