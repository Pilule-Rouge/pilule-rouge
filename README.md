# Pilule Rouge
---

Pilule Rouge is a fork of the [Crunch Hunt package](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/CrunchHunt/tree/devel/packages/crunchhunt). Here are the modifications we made:

* General system to compute and add post's shares. (it's not just for the Techcrunch's articles anymore)
* Ability to update the about page directly from the Admin panel.
