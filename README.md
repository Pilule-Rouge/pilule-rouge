# Pilule Rouge
---

Pilule Rouge is a fork of the [Crunch Hunt package](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/CrunchHunt/tree/devel/packages/crunchhunt) that provides additional features to the [Telescope](http://telesc.pe) project. Here are the modifications we made:

* General system to compute post's shares. (it's not just for the Techcrunch's articles anymore)
* Ability to update the about page directly from the Admin panel.
* Automatic category linking based on keywords set in the title and the description. (after customization in the admin panel)
* Encoding fixes for RSS feeds.
