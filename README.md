# Pilule Rouge
---

[Pilule Rouge](http://www.pilulerouge.net/) is a fork of the [Crunch Hunt package](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/CrunchHunt/tree/devel/packages/crunchhunt) that provides additional features to the [Telescope](http://telesc.pe) project. Here are the modifications we made:

* [x] General system to compute post's shares. (it's not just for the Techcrunch's articles anymore)
* [x] Ability to update the about page directly from the Admin panel.
* [ ] Automatic category linking based on keywords set in the title and the description. (after customization in the admin panel)

To use this package, download and put the folder in the `packages` directory of your Telescope application. Don't forget to append `pilule-rouge` to the `packages` file in your `.meteor` folder.
